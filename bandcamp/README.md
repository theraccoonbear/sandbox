### Bandcamp Records For The Year

A simple Perl script, and related scraping modules, to access Bandcamp user collection data.

`get-user-albums-for-the-year` is a script that will load a group of user's records for 2016.

Save a copy of `config.sample.json` as `config.json`, editing the `users_to_list` array.

### TODO:
 * Make year changeable through `config.json` and/or a --year | -y command line argument.
